    This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the job market for data-related roles across North America. We collected real-time data from Adzuna's API and analyzed thousands of job listings to identify trends in salaries, job roles, and locations. The visualizations shown here are designed to offer both macro-level insights and micro-level breakdowns based on filters like location and company.

    Our machine learning model leverages a Random Forest Regression approach and was trained on features such as job titles, seniority levels, and geographic location. The model has proven to be highly effective, achieving over 90% accuracy on test data. This allows the platform to deliver reliable salary predictions that reflect current hiring trends.

    With this tool, job seekers can benchmark expected salaries based on their job titles and desired regions. At the same time, companies can analyze industry trends and optimize their compensation packages to remain competitive in attracting talent.

    The prediction error is calculated as the difference between predicted and actual salaries. This metric serves as a diagnostic tool to evaluate how well our machine learning model is performing across different job categories, companies, and locations.

    A tightly clustered error distribution around zero suggests that our predictions are very close to actual salaries for most records. Large deviations are visible in only a few cases, typically due to jobs with vague descriptions or outliers in pay scales.

    Monitoring this error is critical for maintaining the quality of our predictions and understanding where our model might be improved in future iterations.
